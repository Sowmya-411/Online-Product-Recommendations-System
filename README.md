# Online-Product-Recommendations-System

In this project, We developed four recommendation systems which will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s hectic world. People are always in the lookout for products/services that are best suited for them. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

Due to time constraints and the accepted level of effort exerted on a search, customers may not be able to go through all of the items on the site. As a result, some customers cannot find the exact item they were looking for or an item they truly desire. Consequently, some customers may purchase an item with a high level of cognitive dissonance or not make a purchase at all.

This is where presenting customers with personalized product recommendations can help. Most of the ecommerce organizations earn 35% of their revenue from recommendation.

Below are the tools used for our project.
Programming Language: Python.
Tool: Jupyter Notebook.

In our Project we have designed a total of 4 recommendations systems based on business context
Recommendation system part I: When a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time
without any product rating. For a business without any user-item purchase history, a search engine based
recommendation system can be designed for users. The product recommendations can be based on
textual clustering analysis given in product description.
Recommendation system part II: Recommendation System using Cosine similarity by implementing the
K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm. I will also predict the rating of the given movie based on its neighbours
and compare it with the actual rating.
Recommendation system part III:
a) Based on product rating we would find out the most popular product and recommend them to
new customers.
b) Once we have the user purchase history. We can recommend user preferred products, by
comparing the user with other similar users based on the products purchase history and their
rating for the product and then recommend them with K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.
