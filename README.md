# Online-Product-Recommendations-System

In this project, We developed four recommendation systems which will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s hectic world. People are always in the lookout for products/services that are best suited for them. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

Due to time constraints and the accepted level of effort exerted on a search, customers may not be able to go through all of the items on the site. As a result, some customers cannot find the exact item they were looking for or an item they truly desire. Consequently, some customers may purchase an item with a high level of cognitive dissonance or not make a purchase at all.

This is where presenting customers with personalized product recommendations can help. Most of the ecommerce organizations earn 35% of their revenue from recommendation.
